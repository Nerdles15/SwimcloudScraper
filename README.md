# Swim Data
Data for swim splits, times, relay splits, etc

Goal is to pull times and splits from various teams for use in further statistical analysis

So far if you input a team ID, then it will parse a maximum number of meets in the 2024-2025 season (user-defined max) and save all events/swimmers/final times to an excel table, with tabs for each meet.

Current version:
Can do:
  --parse user-defined # of meets
  --identify events within the meet
  --identify teams/individuals within each event
  --selenium integration confirmed to be able to parse split table
  --print to excel output for future datamining

Need to update/fix:
  --selenium parsing works for relays but not individual events (yet)
  --associate swimmer names with their split legs in dictionary for relays
  --different logic relay vs individual event for split handling?
  --ensure compatibility with parsing relay events with > 4 splits (400 yard = 8 splits for 4 swimmers, 800 yard = 16 splits for 4 swimmers)
  be nice to host site to avoid rate limiting...we want to be doing ethical scraping :)
